Node.js script that performs the following tasks when executed:
Fetch Weather Data


Use any public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, free tier is fine).


Fetch weather for a specific city (city name will be configurable , you can allow to take city name as input from the user).


Extract the following details from the API response:


City name


Temperature


Weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rain)


Current Time of that city



Format Report


Create a human-readable message containing the weather details.


Example format:

 Weather Report for Lahore  
Temperature: 32Â°C  
Condition: Cloudy  
Reported Time: 1:00 PM   

Send Notification to Slack


Send the formatted weather message to a Slack channel or Group (create one with Behzad Khadim and AmmarFarooq) using a Slack webhook (webhook URL will be configurable).


Logging


Store API request and response details in a log file: logs/weather.log.


Maintain logs only for the last 7 days (older logs should be automatically deleted). ((((((can only be done if we use backend storage- so ignore for now ))))))



Deliverable: A single Node.js script that runs and performs the above steps
